## Advanced Carbon Footprint Calculator

The Advanced Carbon Footprint Calculator is a desktop application developed using Python and Flet. This tool enables users to estimate their carbon footprint based on everyday activities such as electricity use, natural gas consumption, water usage, driving, air travel, and meat consumption. It offers a visual breakdown of emissions using pie or bar charts and supports both metric and imperial units.

### Features

- **Input Categories**: Estimate emissions based on various factors, including electricity (kWh), gas (therms), water (liters/gallons), driving (km/miles), flights per year, and food consumption (kg/lbs).
- **Unit Toggle**: Easily switch between metric (kg CO2e) and imperial (lbs CO2e) units.
- **Visualization**: Analyze your carbon footprint breakdown through Pie Charts or Bar Charts.
- **Progress Bar**: Track your total footprint in relation to a reference value of 5000 kg or 11000 lbs per month.
- **Data Persistence**: Save your inputs to a JSON file for later access.
- **Dark Theme**: Enjoy a modern and user-friendly interface with an optional dark theme.
- **Error Handling**: Benefit from input validation and clear error messages to enhance usability.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Flet**: Version 0.25.0 or higher (utilizes Colors and Icons enums).

Feel free to fork the repository, make enhancements, and submit pull requests. Suggestions for updating emission factors or adding new features are always welcome!
